10. Have two divs side by side - lets call them "Form Div" and "View Div".<br>
a. The first div - "Form Div" should have a simple form with fields - first name, last name, gender, state (select box)
and "Save" button.<br>
b. The "View Div" should have a button called "EDIT" - but this button should be hidden by default.<br>
c. When you click on the "Save" button, the user entered data should appear in the "View Div" - also the form input
fields should be cleared out (should be empty).<br>

d. The View Div should display form data in span tags or p tags or div tags but not as input tags. Also the "EDIT"
button should now be visible.<br>
e. When you click on the "EDIT" button, the form should be repopulated with the data so that you can make some changes
and save again.
